Teaching number\-sense to middle school students and advanced algebra and calculus to university students exposed me to a variety of teaching methods and styles\.  This essay explores common and critical aspects to my success at both: the use of backward design and the supplementary use of data analysis\.  
 
Backward design curriculum utilizes a similar algorithmic framework as in computer programming\.  This requires beginning with the goal in mind, then moving backwards to develop tasks that realize the goal\.   So creating curriculum demands breaking down grade\-level, state\-standards into assessable unit plans and those into daily lesson plans\.  Backward design also applies to daily planning, as seen in the objective, “students will be able to subtract fractions with unequal denominators\.” A skilled teacher identifies and plans each skill: subtracting integers, making equivalent fractions with common denominators, finding the least common denominator, multiplying integers, and recognizing why common denominators are necessary\. 
 
It is critical to map the path to a learning standard, and appropriately benchmark mastery of the goal\.  Bloom’s taxonomy is a good classification system for determining low\-order to high\-order cognitive assessments\.   For example, real world application of subtracting fractions is a higher on the Bloom’s scale because it requires additional synthesis and application skills\.  With this in mind, the expert incorporates the multitude of Bloom’s taxonomies as goals when using backward design\. 
 
Interestingly, the important teachers tool of data analysis also parallels a skill found in programming: testing and debugging\.  Both require well\-designed tests and analysis of results to address root problems\.  Strong teachers identify and address student misunderstandings\.  There are two forms of assessment, formative and summative\.  Formative assessments are informal checks for understanding (CFU) such as mid\-lesson questions, and exit tickets at the end of class\.  Ideal CFUs are measurable, access multiple learning styles, and assess all, if not the overwhelming majority, of students\.  Data from exit tickets determines whether the class is ready for the next learning objective\.  I move to the next objective only if the class average exceeds 80%\.   I also use the data to identify students in need of immediate remediation to ensure all students have the prerequisite skills for future lessons\. 
 
Summative assessments test student mastery of learning standards at the end of a given unit\.  To ensure data reliability, a proper exams assesses multiple Bloom taxonomies and provides a minimum of 5 data points for each objective\.   By analyzing the data, effective teachers re\-design upcoming curriculum\.  Generally, the material must be “spiraled” when the class averages between 60% to 80% on a given standard\.  The teacher spirals the material by supplementing future curriculum with materials not mastered and individualizing lessons for students on those objectives\.  For standards where the class averaged below 60%, it is important to re\-adjust the long\-term plan and explicitly reteach the material to the entire class, but provide differentiation the highest performing students\.
