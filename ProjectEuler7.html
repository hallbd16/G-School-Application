2. Stop the loop when the array is 10001 elements in length.
3. Write the last element of the array.

Notes about the process:
Initially, I chose to use a 'for loop,' but decided I did not like the limitations of the exit condition that comes along with 'for loops.' 
So I decided to use a while loop because it allowed me to have a different exit condition than that associated with variable i.  

Debrief thoughts:
The runtime of the program is very slow because it relies on brute force.
There is another, perhaps more efficient, way to solve the problem without arrays.
Instead of an array, make the loop in the pushPrime function add one to a counter when the number is prime.
Set the condition of the 'while loop' to break when the counter is at the 100001st term and write that n value.
I settled on the less efficient method because it allowed me to use more javascript features.
