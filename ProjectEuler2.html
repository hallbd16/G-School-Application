Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence isgenerated by adding
the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, 
the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values

<!-- 
Debrief thoughts:  
A quicker way that did not require a recursive function, 
however, I wanted to explore the programming more than just solving a math program.

Seeing that a recursive function can be viewed as three repeating values 
where every third term beggining at the second term is even(b).  (a, 2, c, a, 8, c, a, 34, c, a, even(b), c ...) 

a=1;
b=2; //this is always the even term
c=3;

while (b< 4000000) {
b += b;
a= b + c;
b= c + a;
c= a + b;
}
